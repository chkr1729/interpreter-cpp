This challenge follows the book
[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Robert Nystrom.

In this challenge we'll build an interpreter for
[Lox](https://craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html), a simple
scripting language. Along the way, we'll learn about tokenization, ASTs,
tree-walk interpreters and more.

# Build

1. Ensure you have `cmake` installed locally
2. Run `./your_program.sh` to run your program, which is implemented in
   `src/main.cpp`.
